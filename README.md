### FSJS Project 6 - Static Node.js and Express Site

Node.js and Express make a powerful pair when used together on the server side, and are used everyday to make fast, modular and dynamic web applications.
- In this project, I used Node.js, Express and Pug templates to create a portfolio site to show off the projects I've built.

### Languages & Techniques Used: 
- Node.js
- Express
- Pug Template
- CSS 
- JavaScript
- Nodemon 

### Steps to open this app:
- download the project files
- unzip them
- open them up in your preferred text editor
- in the terminal, run `npm install` to install the dependencies
- run `npm start` to launch the app
- then http://localhost:8000 to view the app in the browser.
- Good luck!


### Exceeds Expectations Requirements
- Run npm start serves the app
- The error.pug template and the page-not-found.pug template have been created and added to the views folder
- The app displays either page-not-found or the error template when the user enter the undefined routes, and it displays the error's status and message properties
- The project has been customized by changing colors, adding different styles.
